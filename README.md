# time-management

## Summary

The employees should be able to access the application and begin adding their activity and submit. 
A person shouldnâ€™t be able to capture more than 8 hours a day. Anything more than 8 hours is flagged as overtime and requires manager approval. 
An implementation of the Approval Workflow is not required.
When a user arrives on the application, the previous entries for the day should be shown.
A greeting to the current logged in user should be shown with their Display Name in the message.

This package will create a SharePoint list upon activation (Time Manamement List) with the necessary fields and contenttype.
